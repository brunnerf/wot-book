//#B Create a new route for a GET request on all sensors and attach a callback function
//#C Reply with the sensor model when this route is selected
//#D This route serves the passive infrared sensor
//#E These routes serve the temperature and humidity sensor
//#F We export router to make it accessible for "requirers" of this file
